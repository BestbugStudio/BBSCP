## Back-end

In the backend you'll be able to manage posts and media for dynamics websites.
You'll also be able to design the front-end by creating divs where you'll link the modules you want.

### Modules

In the future we'll create some presets modules but if needed you'll be able to develop your custom module and use it.

A best practice for the modules is that they have to be developed using MVC

The presets modules will be:
* Article loader
* Slideshow
* Photogallery
* Mapmanager
* Social

A custom module must be developed in Object Orientation. It needs:
* a file named modconfig.xml where you have to specify
	+ Module name
	+ Module shortname
	+ Menu (parent and child menu providing the options they will need to add in $_GET query)
* a getView($options) method in your main class that will show your view customized using the options you provided in modconfig.xml
* an index.php that will ONLY return the main object of your module. The manager will automatically execute $yourObject->getView($options_you_provided)

Best practices:
* a class folder where you'll save the classes you'll use to manage datas
* custom css and js folders
* use of MVC design pattern


## Front-end


### INSTALLATION
