## Back-end

In the backend you'll be able to manage posts and media for dynamics websites.
You'll also be able to design the front-end by creating divs where you'll link the modules you want.

### Modules

In the future we'll create some presets modules but if needed you'll be able to develop your custom module and use it.

A best practice for the modules is that they have to be developed using MVC

The presets modules will be:
	- Article loader
	- Slideshow
	- Photogallery
	- Mapmanager
	- Social

A custom module must have
 	- a file named module-config.xml where you have to specify
 		- Module name
 		- Module shortname
 	- an index.php that will be the view of the module
 	- a controller.php that will be your controller
 	- a class folder where you'll save the classes you'll use to manage datas
 	- css and js folders


## Front-end


### INSTALLATION

index.php will attempt a connection to the database and start the installation routine, it will

* ask for some informations
* Install the database and create the first user
* Redirect to /admin/index.php
